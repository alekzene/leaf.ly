**Language/s:** Kotlin + Java  
**Framework:** Spring Boot  
**Build Type:** Gradle  
Initialized with Spring Initializr  

**Dependencies:** Spring Web, Mustache, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Boot DevTools

**DevNotes**: 
* I'm making this project because I want to check out the Kotlin-Java interoperability. Also, my brother has a (sorta) strange web app idea.
* The name is unofficial and has yet to change.
* I'll initially try simple frontend using Spring, then move to a dedicated frontend framework for future versions.

**To Do:** Review Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
