# leafly
**Language/s:** Kotlin + Java  
**Framework:** Spring  
**Build Type:** Gradle  
Initialized with Spring Initializr  

**Currently:** Creating the UI/UX design.  

**To Do:** Review Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.

**DevNotes**: 
* I'm making this project because I want to check out the Kotlin-Java interoperability. Also, my brother has a (sorta) strange web app idea.
* The name is unofficial and has yet to change.
* I'll initially try simple frontend using Spring, then move to a dedicated frontend framework for future versions.
